Road Trip

The purpose of this application is to aid users in making the most of their
road trips by making them aware of attractions and sights that are near to their
driving route that they otherwise would miss.

For example, a user could specify a road trip between Hamilton and Wellington.
After selecting a route, the web application would identify sights and places
near the route that might be of interest to the user.  Exclusion or inclusion
of sites may be based on user preferences
